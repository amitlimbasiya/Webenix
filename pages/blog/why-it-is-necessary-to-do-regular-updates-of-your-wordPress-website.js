                <h3>1. Security</h3>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, WordPress is one of the preferred platforms for developing websites. Hence, it is commonly used to build eCommerce portals, business websites, social networking sites, blogs, forums, and many more such websites. Additionally, WordPress has numerous templates for different types of websites, making it all the more attractive for amateur website designers to use the platform to design websites and web pages. Since it can be used by several people from individuals, to amateurs to experts, it is vital to keep the platform upgraded. WordPress is a self-hosted and open-source platform. This means anyone can use the platform to design a website. Thus, it becomes necessary to keep upgrading the platform&apos;s security protocols to provide adequate protection to anyone using WordPress to build a website. Hence, you need to upgrade your WordPress website to the latest version to have the same security protocols across the ecosystem. This will protect your website against hackers, malicious third parties, and data thieves. The latest security protocols will also protect your website from malicious codes and worms.

                <h3>2. New features</h3>
                <p>WordPress is an open-source platform that believes in innovating and providing its clients with new and improved features to enhance their websites. If you use an old version of the WordPress website, you will not have access to the platform&apos;s latest features. WordPress uses support forums to update users and clients about the WordPress platform&apos;s latest features and versions. For example, if you are using the WordPress platform to develop an eCommerce platform, you must have a user interface that is interactive and easy to understand. The older versions of the platform used the standard UI, which provided the user&apos;s necessary facilities. But if you upgrade it to WordPress 5.3, you will find that your website has a better user interface. Better UI means an increased amount of web traffic to your website. As a result, your website will be accessed by a broader customer base, and in the long run, it will prove to be an excellent marketing tool. Thus, to gain access to all the latest features and enhance your website&apos;s usability, you must upgrade your WordPress website to the latest version.</p>

Hence, a website with proper SEO protocols in place and uses the latest WordPress version will be identified faster by the web crawlers. The platform&apos;s speed will also indicate the speed of loading the website on the Search Engine Result Pages or SERPs.
