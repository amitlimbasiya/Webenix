                <p>If you plan to use Facebook as a platform to promote the products and services offered by your company, you must understand how your prospective clients will perceive these business promotions. For example, you need to stay updated with the latest trends to impact the platform. The advertisements that you use should refer to the ongoing socio-economic conditions to show that you are aware of the problems being faced by your clients and the efforts that you are taking to make it easier for them. This is especially true for eCommerce platforms that use Facebook as one forum for advertising their products. Some of the predictions for Facebook advertisement for the year 2021 are as follows:</p>

              <s.BlogContentWrapper>
                <h3>1. Limiting the events</h3>
                <p>The year 2021 will see limitations on the number of event conversions for Facebook. Facebook will be limiting eight event conversions per domain. This is applicable even for pixel events, and the advertisements have to be optimized for these events. Facebook will consider every event under a given domain, and the domain manager will be allowed to configure eight such events under a specific domain. Hence, if you are looking to use Facebook to advertise your products and services, you will get eight default event conversions under a single domain.</p>

              <s.BlogContentWrapper>
                <h3>2. Video advertisements will see a rise in the upcoming year.</h3>
                <p>In the year 2021, a video advertisement will gain precedence over images and screenshots. Video advertisements have more impact and can reach out to a broader customer base. If you use video as a part of your Facebook advertisement campaigns, you increase your chances of prospective clients checking out the associated link. Subsequently, this will increase the web traffic to your company&#39;s website. Moreover, video carousel advertisement cost about ten percent of still images and can prove to be a better investment compared to static images. Thus, in the long run, video advertisements will be the preferred medium of advertising your products and services on Facebook.</p>

              <s.BlogContentWrapper>
                <h3>3. Advertisement formats will become personal</h3>
                <p>Facebook is an interactive platform where people can communicate with each other. Hence, when using the platform to advertise their products and services, business organizations need to get personal with their customers. The advertisements developed for Facebook should have a personal touch to associate better with the firm. This is the upcoming trend with Facebook advertisements. If you are thinking of using Facebook as the preferred platform for advertising your company, you should consider developing personal video advertisements, and the audience finds them relatable.</p>

                <p>In 2021 Facebook advertisements will become different as they will be more about the audience than the company. You will have to design the advertisements considering the changed socio-economic condition and the client&#39;s changed mindset. Moreover, Facebook has developed protocols to make it easier for advertisers to identify the best methods to reach out to a broader customer base through the platform. Thus, in the upcoming year, Facebook advertisements will change and become more about the companies, people, and changes people have undergone.</p>
