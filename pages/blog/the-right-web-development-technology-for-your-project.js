                <p>Choosing the right web development technologies is crucial and one that could greatly influence the end result of your project. Think of web development technology as the foundation of your building. With a strong foundation, you could build a 15-storey building that can last for decades but if you have a weak foundation, even a 3-storey building could crumble within a year.</p>
                <p>To have a strong building, you need a stronger foundation and to build a great web project, you need the right set of web development technologies, ones that can keep your website up and running for as long as possible. Today, let’s take a minute or two to figure out the web technologies that are going to be perfect for you and a few tips on how to choose them. We will also discuss how profitable it is going to be in the long run. Let’s get started.</p>

                <h3>Which Web Development Technology is Going Perfect For Your Project?</h3>
                <p>When it comes to websites, web development, and web app development, there are two sides to it. One, there’s the client side, also known as the front end and then there’s the server side, also known as the back end. Think of the back end as the foundation, bricks, concrete, and so on, while the front end is the decor stuff that you see. Let’s take a look in detail.</p>

                <h3>Back-End Web Development Technologies</h3>
                <p>A majority of the work done for web development technologies goes into the back end. The back end is responsible for the entirety of the CRUD operations, which stands for Create, Read, Update, and Demand. It’s the back end that does most of the grunt work. Here are some of the things that you will need to bring up to get the development of the back end started.</p>
                <p>Web Development Technologies Needed to Start the Back end Development</p>
                <ul className='blog-listing'>
                  <li>Web hosting server </li>
                  <li>Database storage </li>
                  <li>Web development technology framework </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Choice of Programming Language</h3>
                <p>Also, to develop the back end, you can choose from the following programming languages-</p>
                <h4><strong>Back-end Tech Stack</strong></h4>
                <p>However, to develop the back-end stack, you will have to choose from the following-</p>
                <ul className='blog-listing'>
                  <li>Wins Stack</li>
                  <li>Xampp</li>
                  <li>Serverless Stack</li>
                </ul>

              <s.BlogContentWrapper>
                <h4><strong>Front-End Web Development Technologies</strong></h4>
                <p>While everybody has an opinion on whether JavaScript is the best or is it HTML/CSS, the numbers don’t lie. According to Statista, one of the largest market researchers, JavaScript is the best programming language when it comes to the front end. In fact, 65.36% voted for it. However, there are no right or wrong choices here. Both JS and HTML/CSS are excellent web development technologies and it all boils down to personal preference and which is going to be better for your web.</p>
                <p>For example, with HTML/CSS combo, you can use HTML to properly format and describe the structure of the user interface while CSS will handle how each layer is displayed on the screen and how the colors, text, and font should appear. While JS, also called JavaScript, is used to create different elements of the back end into an interactive display that can be rendered by a web browser.</p>

                <h4><strong>5 Tips On How To Choose The Best Web Development Technology</strong></h4>
                <p>Which web development technologies should you go for will depend on what you need and which technologies have them. Let’s get started.</p>
              </s.BlogContentWrapper>
              <s.BlogContentWrapper>
                <h4><strong>The Size and Complexity of Your Project</strong></h4>
                <p>The size of your project and its complexity plays a big role. To handle the size, you will need the right tech stack, whereas, for complexities and added layers, it will depend on the choice of programming language you made.</p>

              <s.BlogContentWrapper>
                <h4><strong>Required Speed and Performance</strong></h4>
                <p>Every project has its projected expectations of speed and performance that you can bring out of the said project. There’s just one major rule here. The more layers and elements you choose to have on-screen, the slower it will load. So, when you design the site, you may want to sacrifice some layers and elements to meet the desired speed and performance. Both JS and HTML/CSS are great web development technologies.</p>

              <s.BlogContentWrapper>
                <h4><strong>System Load Requirements</strong></h4>
                <p>Every temple, element, and layer you have on the screen will have an impact on the system, which may cause the system to go under a higher load than usual. So, if you are worried about requirements, you will need to retrospect the design and move on accordingly.</p>
              </s.BlogContentWrapper>
              <s.BlogContentWrapper>
                <h4><strong>Flexibility and Scalability</strong></h4>
                <p>Flexibility is the key to web development technology. The web is constantly changing and updating, and yours must be able to keep up. Scalability is another important factor. You may have designed and structured the webpage based on the 24-inch monitor that you have. But the problem is not everybody has the same size or even the same resolution. Your web page must be able to scale according to the windows size and the resolution of the said screen.</p>
              </s.BlogContentWrapper>
              <s.BlogContentWrapper>
                <h4><strong>Security</strong></h4>
                <p>Security is another area where web development technologies excel. They have multi-layered firewall protection that protects your data and keeps them safe from prying eyes. Every data of your project will be protected. Even your database will be protected against popular SQL injection attacks. Modern web technologies have some of the best firewall setups.</p>
