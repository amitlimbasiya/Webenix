                <h3>Output-driven contract models</h3>
                <p>Till now, the companies were only worried about the outcomes of any project; they could not visualize the impact the quantity aspect had. With better learning developed over the period, now the contracts are keeping value-driven outcomes as clauses.

The money will become secondary; more focus will be laid on the risks and responsibilities that vendors would need to carry.</p>
